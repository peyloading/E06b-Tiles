# E06b-Tiles

I edited the map using tiled map editor to create a cute and fun map to move around on. I created a fake barrier using stars, however, I realize that this is ineffective since I ended up falling off anyways. Once you get to the stars, you should try and jump towards the top left. I also changed the jump speed to be able to jump a tad higher to reach the platform that I wanted him to reach.
